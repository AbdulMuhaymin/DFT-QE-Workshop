It is the basis of many-body theory. Sometimes it is desirable to talk about a small set of interacting quasiparticles instead of large number of non-interacting electrons. This quasiparticle description fails when their creation time is much larger/smaller than their decay time, however.
# QM
The mathematical arena in which QM works is Hilbert space (infinite-dimensional vector space). 
## Single particle Hilbert space:
single particle Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}_{1}$ whose eigenfunctions are given by $|\chi\rangle$ where $|\chi\rangle$ is given by $|\lambda\rangle$  where $|\lambda\rangle$ is a complete set of states, and $|\lambda\rangle\langle\lambda|=\mathbb{1}$ .
$$\hat{H}_{1}|\chi\rangle = \varepsilon_{\lambda} |\lambda\rangle  $$

# Propagators
In QM, we can find the wave function $\Psi(x,t)$ by solving time-dependent Schrodinger's equation (TDSE) which is: $$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t)=\hat{H}\Psi(x,t)$$Now, we propose an ansatz for the solution of $\Psi(x,t)$ of the form: $$\Psi(x,t)=\sum_n c_n(t)\; u_n(x)$$where $u_n(x)$ is the basis function and $c_n(t) = c_n(0)e^{-iE_nt/\hbar}$, where $c_n(0)=\int \Psi(x,0)\;u_n^*(x) dx$. So,$$\begin{split}\Psi(x,t) & = \sum_n c_n(0) \; e^{-iE_nt/\hbar}\; u_n(x) \\ 
						& =\sum_n \left[\int \Psi(x',0) \; u_n^*(x') dx'\right] \; e^{-iE_nt/\hbar}\; u_n(x)\\
						& = \int G(x,x',t) \; \Psi(x',0) \; dx' \end{split}$$Here, $G(x,x',t)$ is the *Propagator* (it propagates the wave function from $x$ to $x'$). $$ \begin{align} G(x,x',t) &=\sum_n u_n(x)\,u_n^*(x')\; e^{-iE_nt/\hbar} \\
				\therefore G(x,x',t) &=\sum_n \langle u_n(x')|u_n(x)\rangle \; e^{-iE_nt/\hbar} \end{align} $$So, we can get the $\Psi(x,t)$ from either (1) by solving TDSE, or (2) by solving the propagator equation. 

Now, using the TDSE and the definition of the propagator, $$\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\hat{H}\right)\Psi(x,t)=\int \left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\hat{H}\right)\,G(x,x',t)\;\Psi(x,0)\,dx'=0$$So, $$\left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\hat{H}\right)\,G(x,x',t)=0$$We want to talk about $t>0$, i.e., we are interested in the path where the system has actually been evolved. In this case, we define a *Retarded propagator* $G_R(x,x',t)$ such that $$ G_R(x,x',t) = G(x,x',t)\;\Theta(t)$$where $\Theta(t)$ is the Heaviside step function defined as follows: $$\Theta(t) = \left\{ \begin{align} 1 \quad\text{for }\quad t>0 \\0 \quad\text{for }\quad t<0 \end{align}\right\} $$That means $G_R$ makes a discontinuous jump from $t=0$ to a finite value. Now, $$ i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}G_R(x,x',t) = \Theta(t)\,i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}G(x,x',t) + i\hbar G(x,x',t) \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Theta(t)$$ But $\frac{d}{dt}\Theta(t)=\delta(t)$. So, $$ i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}G_R(x,x',t) = \Theta(t)\;i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}G(x,x',t) + i\hbar G(x,x',t) \delta(t)$$Now by using TDSE for $G(x,x',t)$, we can write the TDSE for $G_R(x,x',t)$: $$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}G_R(x,x',t) = \Theta(t)\hat{H}G(x,x',t)+ i\hbar G(x,x',0)$$ $$\therefore \left(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}-\hat{H}\right)\,G_R(x,x',t)= i\hbar\,\delta(x-x')\,\delta(t)$$ This is the Schrodinger's equation for the retarded propagator.
