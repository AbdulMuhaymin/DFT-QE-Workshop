## ðŸ’¬ Support for Registered Participants

Once your registration is confirmed, you will be added to a **private Facebook group** dedicated to workshop participants. You can use the group to:

- Ask questions
- Share ideas or issues
- Stay updated with announcements

However, we understand that Facebook isn't ideal for all technical discussions. For more structured help (with code formatting, logs, etc.), you can create a GitHub issue here:

## ðŸ§  External Q&A: Matter Modeling Stack Exchange

The [Matter Modeling Stack Exchange](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/) is a great platform for questions related to:

- Computational chemistry
- Condensed matter physics
- DFT and electronic structure methods

Before posting, check if your question has already been answered. Many common problems already have detailed solutions.
